      Score each section from 0-100. Calculate overallScore as the average of 4 sections (excluding ATS) and round to nearest integer.
      Be thorough and detailed. Don't be afraid to point out mistakes or give low scores.
      
      The job title is: ${jobTitle}
      The job description is: ${jobDescription}
      
      Analyze these 5 areas:
      1. ATS - How well the resume passes Applicant Tracking Systems
      2. toneAndStyle - Professional language, appropriate tone
      3. content - Relevant experience, achievements, impact
      4. structure - Layout, organization, formatting
      5. skills - Technical and soft skills relevance
      
      IMPORTANT: overallScore must be the mathematical average of 4 section scores: (toneAndStyle + content + structure + skills) / 4. Do NOT include ATS in the overall score calculation. Round to the nearest integer.
      
      Provide the feedback using the following format:

      Return the analysis as a JSON object, without any other text and without backticks.
